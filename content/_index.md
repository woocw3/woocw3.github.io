        My research investigates the intersection of **technology, innovation, and corporate governance** through an accounting and management lens.

        **Key Research Areas:**

        - **Information Security & Cybersecurity**: Examining corporate disclosure practices, investment efficiency, and the impact of cybersecurity on firm performance

        - **ESG & Sustainability**: Analyzing how environmental, social, and governance initiatives affect corporate strategy and financial outcomes

        - **Innovation & R&D Management**: Investigating R&D performance, technology commercialization, and innovation efficiency across industries

        - **Technology Management**: Exploring the role of technology in organizational decision-making and performance management systems

        I employ empirical methods and quantitative analysis to understand how firms' strategic decisions regarding innovation, ESG initiatives, and risk management impact financial and operational outcomes.

        With **35 peer-reviewed publications** in leading journals including *Technology Analysis & Strategic Management*, *Journal of Cleaner Production*, and *Business Strategy and the Environment*, my research contributes to both academic knowledge and practical insights for organizations navigating digital transformation and sustainability challenges.
