I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Accounting at Changwon National University. My research bridges accounting, technology management, and sustainability, focusing on how organizations navigate digital transformation and environmental challenges.

## Background

Before joining Changwon National University in 2024, I served as Assistant Professor at Kyungnam University (2022-2024) and as a Research Fellow at the Science and Technology Policy Institute (STEPI, 2016-2022), where I led R&D planning and policy research initiatives.

## Research Impact

With 35+ peer-reviewed publications in leading international journals including *Technology Analysis & Strategic Management*, *Journal of Cleaner Production*, and *Business Strategy and the Environment*, my research contributes to understanding:

- How firms invest in and disclose cybersecurity initiatives
- The relationship between ESG performance and corporate innovation
- R&D efficiency and technology commercialization strategies
- The role of management accounting in technology-driven organizations

I welcome collaboration opportunities and inquiries from prospective students interested in technology management, innovation accounting, and sustainability research.
